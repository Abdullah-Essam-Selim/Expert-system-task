# Wine Classification Project
## Description
This project aims to classify different types of wines based on their chemical attributes using machine learning techniques.
The Wine dataset, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, is used for training and evaluation.

## Dataset Information
The Wine dataset consists of chemical analysis results of wines from three different cultivars in the same region of Italy. 
The dataset contains 13 attributes, including **alcohol content**, **malic acid**, **ash**, **alcalinity of ash**, **magnesium**, **total phenols**, **flavanoids**, **nonflavanoid phenols**, **proanthocyanins**, **color intensity**, **hue**, **OD280/OD315 of diluted wines**, and **proline**. 

The target variable **=>** indicates the cultivar class.

## Installation
To run the code in this project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

shell
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

# Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed.
3. Run the code file wine_classification.py using Python.
4. The code will load the Wine dataset, perform data exploration, split the data into training and validation sets, apply various classification algorithms, and evaluate their performance using cross-validation.

# Results and Evaluation
The classification models are evaluated using cross-validation with accuracy as the evaluation metric.<br>
The mean accuracy and standard deviation for each model are printed to the console.<br>
The results provide insights into the performance of different algorithms in classifying the wine types based on their chemical attributes.

# Folder Structure
**wine_classification.py:** Main code file that loads the dataset, performs classification, and evaluates the models.<br>
**README.md**: Documentation file providing information about the project.
Any additional files or directories you find necessary for your project.

# Credits
